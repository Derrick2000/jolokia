/**
 * <p>A detector identifies a specific server. This is typically done by inspecting
 * the runtime environment e.g. for the existence of certain classes. If a detector
 * successfully detect 'its' server, it returns a {@link ServerHandle} containing type, version
 * and some optional information. For the early detection of a server by the JVM agent,
 * {@link #jvmAgentStartup(Instrumentation)} can be used. Using these methods is useful in case
 * the server is using its own class loaders to load components used by Jolokia (e.g jmx, Java logging
 * which is indirectly required by the sun.net.httpserver).</p>
 *
 * <p>A detector is used in two stages - first during agent startup (possibly waiting for runtime initialization)
 * and then later when Jolokia Service Manager starts to detect {@link ServerHandle}.</p>
