== Jmx4Perl

As described in this link:../about.html[story], Jolokia has its origins
in the Perl world where it starts as a simple solution for monitoring
Java Java EE applications with
https://www.nagios.org[Nagios]. https://www.jmx4perl.org[Jmx4perl]
was its former name, which in addition the agents contains
powerfule Perl modules for accessing Jolokia instrumented
servers. These modules are the foundation for tools like
`check_jmx4perl`, a Nagios plugin with a rich feature set,
`jmx4perl`, a command line utility for accessing the agents and
`j4psh`, a readline based remote JMX shell.

Jmx4perl requests looks like

[source,bash]
----
use strict;
use JMX::Jmx4Perl;
use JMX::Jmx4Perl::Alias;   # Import MBean aliases

# Basic usage
print "Memory Used: ",
      JMX::Jmx4Perl
          ->new(url => "http://localhost:8080/jolokia")
          ->get_attribute(MEMORY_HEAP_USED);

# Advanced:
my $jmx = new JMX::Jmx4Perl(url => "http://localhost:8080/jolokia",
                           product => "jboss");
my $request = new JMX::Jmx4Perl::Request({type => READ,
                                         mbean => "java.lang:type=Memory",
                                         attribute => "HeapMemoryUsage",
                                         path => "used"});
my $response = $jmx->request($request);
print "Memory used: ",$response->value(),"\n";
