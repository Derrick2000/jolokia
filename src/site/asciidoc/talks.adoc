== JayDay 2013

The slides to my talk for the small but very fine link:https://www.jayday.de[JayDay 2013,role=externalLink] are
link:https://ro14nd.de/talks/2013/jayday-javascript-jmx/index.html[online,role=externalLink].
These are "implemented" in JavaScript including live demos, where the JavaScript can be directly inserted
in the browser (tested with Chrome and Firefox). For the sample code, simply push the blue buttons at the
bottom of a link:https://ro14nd.de/talks/2013/jayday-javascript-jmx/index.html#/step-20[demo slide,role=externalLink].

== OSMC 2011

This link:https://www.netways.de/index.php?id=3031&L=1[talk,role=externalLink]
from the link:https://www.netways.de/en/osmc/y2011/overview/[Open Source Monitoring Conference,role=externalLink]
was given 2011 in Nuremberg.
It focuses on the integration of
Jolokia within Nagios and was given in German. I was the
'Java guy' this year. It was my third time at OSMC and it
was as always a big pleasure to meet the Nagios folks and
catering was phantastic, too ;-)

== Osgish

This screencast demos the cousin of j4psh, osgish an Perl bases OSGi shell which uses Jolokia and Aries for
managing OSGi container. It works well, but is still yet some sort of prototype. The screencast is cool nevertheless ;-)
