== Jolokia Maven modules

This page describes available Maven artifacts and shows changes introduced in Jolokia 2.0

=== Jolokia 1.x modules

In Jolokia 1.x, there are two groups of Maven modules:

* https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/tree/v1.7.2/agent[agent modules]
* https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/tree/v1.7.2/client[client modules]

.Agent modules

By Jolokia _agent_ we mean an _entity_ that exposes internal structure o the application (JMX) to outside world (HTTP clients). Assuming this analogy, the agent modules include (groupId is `org.jolokia`, artifactId is shown in the table):

[%autowidth.stretch,role=bodyTable]
|===
|Artifact ID|Description

|`jolokia-core`
|Core agent functionality which is sufficient to run Jolokia agent with JMX access and JSON serialization

|`jolokia-jmx`
|Helper module that makes it easier to register MBean using Jolokia own https://jolokia.org/reference/html/jmx.html[JMX MBean Server]
|`jolokia-jsr160`
|Agent module that adds JSR 160 request dispatcher which allows Jolokia to operate on MBeans registered in remote MBean Servers using JSR-160 JMX Remote protocol.

|`jolokia-jvm`
|A standalone Jolokia agent that can be configured using `-javaagent` JVM argument and uses JDK own HTTP server to expose JMX over HTTP

|`jolokia-spring`
|Spring agent that extends `jolokia-jvm` by adding https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework[Spring Framework] integration (e.g., dedicated https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.1.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/extensible-xml.html[Spring XML namespace handler])

|`jolokia-osgi`
|OSGi agent that uses https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.http.html[OSGi CMPN Http Service] API to register Jolokia Agent Servlet within OSGi runtime

|`jolokia-osgi-bundle`
|OSGi agent which is packaged with https://github.com/apache/felix-dev/tree/master/http[Felix HTTP service]

|`jolokia-war`
|WAR agent which is packaged as standard Web Application compliant with Servlet API 4

|`jolokia-war-unsecured`
|WAR agent without security enabled
|===

.Client modules

Client modules are used to connect to available Jolokia Agent over HTTP protocol:

[%autowidth.stretch,role=bodyTable]
|===
|Artifact ID|Description

|`jolokia-client-java`
|Dedicated client based on https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/index.html[Apache HTTP Client 4]

|`jolokia-client-javascript`
|Maven module containing Javascript libraries

|`jolokia-jmx-adapter`
|Special _reversed_ client library. It contains implementation of `javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorProvider` allowing to use standard JMX Remote API to access external Jolokia Agent. It can be used in tools like JConsole or https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jdk-mission-control.html[Java Mission Control]. It uses JMX URIs in the form of `service:jmx:jolokia://<host>:<port>/jolokia/<path>`.

|`jolokia-kubernetes`
|An implementation of `javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorProvider` handling JMX URIs in the form of `service:jmx:kubernetes///<namespace>/http(s):<pod>:port/jolokia` to access JMX Agents exposed inside accessible Kubernetes cluster. It uses https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster-services/#manually-constructing-apiserver-proxy-urls[Kubernetes Proxy URLs].
|===

=== Jolokia 2.0 modules

Jolokia 2 is fully restructured to embrace modularization and pluggability. This makes the _core_ library slimmer. However more libraries than just _core_ are required to provide basic functionality.

Maven artifacts are also renamed. We follow a convention where artifact ID (which physically is all we get in the resulting file/jar name) fully identifies the contained functionality. That's why for example we've renamed:

* `jolokia-core` to `jolokia-server-core`
* `jolokia-jvm` to `jolokia-agent-jvm`
* `jolokia-jsr160` to `jolokia-service-jsr160`

We have now 5 groups of modules:

* https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/tree/2.0/server[server modules]
* https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/tree/2.0/service[service modules]
* https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/tree/2.0/agent[agent modules]
* https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/tree/2.0/client[client modules]
* https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/tree/2.0/support[support modules]

.Server modules

One module provides core Jolokia functionality:

[%autowidth.stretch,role=bodyTable]
|===
|Artifact ID|Description

|`jolokia-server-core`
|It's roughly the same as Jolokia 1 `jolokia-core` but without serializers, request dispatchers and additional services (like history or discovery)
|===

Core Jolokia library is extended with pluggable services which are implemented in service modules and discovered using a method similar to `java.util.ServiceLoader` with additiona features.

These services are declared in `/META-INF/jolokia/<kind>[-default]` files:

[%autowidth.stretch,role=bodyTable]
|===
|kind|interface|description

|`services`
|`org.jolokia.server.core.service.api.JolokiaService`
|Generic Jolokia service which is looked-up using more specific interface and use in Jolokia core.

|`detectors`
|`org.jolokia.server.core.detector.ServerDetector`
|A service used to find appserver specific `MBeanServer` instances

|`simplifiers`
|`org.jolokia.service.serializer.json.simplifier.SimplifierExtractor`
|A service used by `org.jolokia.service.serializer.json.ObjectToJsonConverter` to convert specific Java objects to JSON representation (for example `java.io.File` is changed into JSON containing `name`, `exists`, `length`, ... properties)
|===

.Service modules

Core Jolokia library discovers services in libraries available on `CLASSPATH`.

[%autowidth.stretch,role=bodyTable]
|===
|Artifact ID|Description

|`jolokia-server-detector`
|S set of built-in services which can be used to detect extra, non-discoverable (see `javax.management.MBeanServerFactory.findMBeanServer()`) `MBeanServer` instances, specific to given application server

|`jolokia-service-discovery`
|Registers `jolokia:type=Discovery` MBean and starts UDP multicast listener to detect other Jolokia Agent processes

|`jolokia-service-history`
|Registers `jolokia:type=Config` MBean which is also a `org.jolokia.server.core.service.request.RequestInterceptor` service. This is used to keep a configurable history of agent invocations.

|`jolokia-service-jmx`
|Mandatory service that adds `org.jolokia.service.jmx.LocalRequestHandler` handler and set of commands. Without this service we wouldn't even be able to access any MBean available within JVM.

|`jolokia-service-jsr160`
|A service that adds `org.jolokia.service.jsr160.Jsr160RequestHandler` that can be used to access remotely-available MBeans (using JSR-160 Remote JMX).

|`jolokia-service-notif-pull`
|A notification service using pulling method

|`jolokia-service-notif-sse`
|A notification service using Server-Sent Events

|`jolokia-service-serializer`
|Mandatory service that is used to convert Java objects into JSON representation.
|===
