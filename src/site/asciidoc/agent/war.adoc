== Webarchive (WAR) Agent

NOTE: Jolokia 2.0 uses Jakarta EE 9+ (Servlet API 5+ with `pass:[jakarta.servlet.*]` packages),
while Jolokia 1.x uses JavaEE/JakartaEE up to version 8 (Servlet API up to version 4 with `pass:[javax.servlet.*]` packages)

This agent is most suitable for Jakarta EE environments. It gets deployed
as a usual web archive (WAR). The specific deployment procedure depends on
the Jakarta EE server in used. E.g. for Tomcat, copy the WAR agent into the `webapps/` directory.

The WAR agent comes in two flavors:

* `jolokia-agent-war.war` which is secured with a role "jolokia". So you need to setup your servlet container to link
this role with your authentication setup (like the `conf/tomcat-users.xml` for Tomcat)
* `jolokia-agent-war-unsecured.war` is completely unsecured and might be useful for a quick evaluation. *Please note that this unauthenticated access should be ony used for development purposes. Check out link:../reference/html/manual/agents.html#agent-war-security[reference manual] for details how to enable security.*

As soon as it is deployed, the agents offers its services under the
URL of the deployed web application. For Tomcat running with its
standard configuration the agent is then reachable under

----
http://localhost:8080/jolokia
----

Setup and configuration of the WAR agent is explained detailed in
the link:../reference/html/manual/agents.html#agents-war[reference manual].
