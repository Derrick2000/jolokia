=== Jolokia has a new home!

[.news-date]
2023-12-01

After years of preparation, reviewing, restructuring, refactoring and polishing, Jolokia 2.0 is released and available in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/jolokia/[Maven Central].

Yes, finally we moved Jolokia from my (rhuss) personal
account to a dedicated GitHub organisation:
https://github.com/jolokia[https://github.com/jolokia,role=externalLink].
I'm super happy that the story of Jolokia continues and you
will see quite some new faces very soon. Thanks Tadayoshi,
Grzegorz, Aur√©lien and all the other fine folks from Red Hat
who started to revive Jolokia. Also, Jolokia 2.0 becomes a realistic
option again. Stay tuned!
