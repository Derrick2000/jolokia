=== Jolokia 2.1.0 released

[.news-date]
2024-08-??

We're happy to announce a new minor release of Jolokia! Minor releases introduce new features and may require a little adjustments to client code. But no worries - client code needs some adjustments _only_ for new Jolokia JavaScript library!

==== New JavaScript libraries

After many (9!) years since the introduction of https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/[ES6 modules] into JavaScript language, we've finally moved JavaScript code from manually created UMD-structured JavaScript files (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function#using_an_immediately_invoked_function_expression_iife[IIFE], https://github.com/umdjs/umd[UMD], https://github.com/myshov/history-of-javascript/tree/master/4_evolution_of_js_modularity[The Evolution of JavaScript Modularity]).

Because nowadays (already for many years actually) JavaScript "scripts" are consumed using packages, Jolokia provides now new Maven module (`org.jolokia:jolokia-client-javascript-esm`) that contains _modern_ JS packages:

* `jolokia.js` - this package, while already present in https://www.npmjs.com/package/jolokia.js now contains different _targets_ - proper ES module and ready to use (in browser) files produced by https://rollupjs.org/[Rollup JS bundler].
* `@jolokia.js/simple` - this package replaces `jolokia-simple.js` file which was part of initial NPM package.

What's more, new JavaScript library is developed using https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] language without affecting end user experience. We have now full definition of types used by Jolokia which already proved to be very useful in finding miscellaneaous problems hidden in type-less JavaScript code.

==== Fetch API

Since Jolokia was created, https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/[JQuery Ajax] was used to perform HTTP calls from JavaScript code. +
Now instead of relying on external dependency, we use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API[Fetch API] which is now standard in all modern, secure browsers. We don't support unsecure browsers nowadays ;) +
This makes Jolokia JavaScript library independent of _any_ external dependency. It also makes the code aware of async/await programming model and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises[Promises API]. See dedicated chapter in link:reference/html/manual/clients.html#client-javascript[reference documentation].

==== New JSON parser

Since https://github.com/jolokia/jolokia/commit/4d7a089e97576836945983ecfbbc92ae818b50ac[first available GitHub commit], Jolokia was using `com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple` JSON parser/serializer library. This library has quite interesting history (moving from https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/[code.google.com] to GitHub, forking, ...) and does its job very well, but we've decided to make a bold move and remove this dependency.

Without adding new external JSON dependency...

Here's what we did - we used https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple/blob/tag_release_1_1_1/doc/json.lex[JSON grammar used by `json-simple`], checked the https://github.com/cliftonlabs/json-simple/blob/json-simple-4.0.1/src/main/lex/jsonstrict.lex[changes made in forked version] and used https://www.jflex.de/[JFlex] to generate Jolokia own lexer. +
Having a working lexer we've built our own flexible parser/serializer to fullful _all_ Jolokia needs. And yes, we've made it ~2x faster (in non-exhaustive tests involving https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Artemis broker] running with 10,000 queues).

New Jolokia module is `org.jolokia:jolokia-json` and it fully replaces `com.googlecode.json-simple:json-simple` library. Class names are the same, the _only_ change is package name (switch from `org.json.simple` to `org.jolokia.json`).

==== New Jolokia protocol version

Going with the flow, after moving from JavaScript to TypeScript and after getting our own JSON parser, we've introduced a new Jolokia protocol version - `8.0`. There's more information in link:reference/html/manual/jolokia_protocol.html#optimized-response-list[relevant documentation section], but here's a summary of the changes.

* with new `listKeys` processing/request parameter, `list()` operation returns additional `"keys"` field for MBean's MBeanInfo - it contains a map of the keys obtained from ObjectName
* with new `includeRequest` processing/request parameter we can tell Jolokia to _not_ return incoming request under `"request"` field of the response (defaults to `false`)
* with new `listCache` processing/request parameter, `list()` operation may be _optimized_. The details are in documentation, but it's enough to say that it allows to cache common JSON-ified MBeanInfo to not duplicate it in `list()` response for, say, 50,000 Artemis queue MBeans. Getting 2MB instead of 0.5GB of JSON is always a good thingâ„¢.

==== New extension points

To make `list()` operation more flexible (based on experience from https://hawt.io/[Hawtio console])), Jolokia now provides _extension points_ for `list()`. While it is still based on `javax.management.MBeanServerConnection.queryMBeans()` call, we don't necessarily blindly serialize each MBean's `javax.management.MBeanInfo`.

* with `org.jolokia.service.jmx.api.CacheKeyProvider` Jolokia service we can ask 3rd party libraries whether given MBean can be translated into a _cache key_. If many MBeans can be translated to single _cache key_ we can optimize the `list()` response by caching common MBeanInfo - imagine 20K queues again...
* with `org.jolokia.service.jmx.handler.list.DataUpdater` Jolokia service, we can get additional information inside JSON-ified `javax.management.MBeanInfo` - 3rd party extensions may add RBAC information or any other data into the MBeanInfo

==== Old issues resolved

It's worth noting that we've also fixed issues dating back to 2015...

* we now support custom date format for dates (and new `java.time` classes)
* we now support multi-dimensional arrays
* we now support `java.util.Date` operation parameters
* we can declare (in `jolokia-access.xml`) that some MBans simply should not be returned in `search` and `list` operations.

=== Jolokia 2.0.3 released

[.news-date]
2024-06-06

Jolokia 2.0.3 is released with 3 minor fixes. Certificate chains are handled better (thanks https://github.com/shayelkin[Shay Elkin]!) and we know allow to configure how `long` values are handled during JSON serialization.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.3[changelog] for detailed information about the release.

=== Jolokia 2.0.2 released

[.news-date]
2024-03-07

Spring time is approaching and we've skimmed through some old issues to clean them up. Jolokia 2.0.2 is released with few minor fixes. Most notably, write-only JMX attributes are now handled correctly and heuristic Jolokia shutdown thread is replaced with proper https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runtime.html#addShutdownHook(java.lang.Thread)[JVM shutdown hook].

We've also ensured that all tests pass on IBM versions of JDK.

Refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.2[changelog] for detailed information about the release.

=== Jolokia 2.0.1 released

[.news-date]
2024-01-26

Following the big 2.0.0 release last year, we continue to improve Jolokia by clearing the backlog and adding new features and improvements.

With 2.0.1 release we're fixing custom log handler configuration. We also integrate better with https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.2.2/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints.enabling[Spring Boot Actuator] by handling `management.endpoint.jolokia.enabled` property.

As always, please refer to https://jolokia.org/changes-report.html#a2.0.1[changelog] for more details.

=== Jolokia 2.0 arrives: A new chapter begins!

[.news-date]
2023-12-19

image::images/jolokia2-presents.png[role="right"]

We are excited to announce the long-awaited release of Jolokia 2.0, now available in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/jolokia/[Maven Central,role=externalLink,window=_blank].

This release is a result of our dedicated effort in reviewing, restructuring, refactoring, and polishing. Here's what Jolokia 2.0 brings to the table:

* Support for JakartaEE 9+ (Servlet API 5+ with `jakarta.servlet` packages)
* Enhanced connectivity with JMX notifications
* Integration with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6
* A fresh, pluggable service-based architecture
* A revamped and user-friendly link:reference/html/index.html[Reference Manual] powered by Antora
* JDK 11 is the minimal version of JDK required. Spring related Jolokia modules require JDK 17. (No worries, we're still supporting Jolokia 1.x with minimal version of JDK 1.6 supported).

And that's not all. We're already planning more frequent updates, including exciting new features like websockets and IPv6 support.

Jolokia 2 also gears up to seamlessly integrate with the upcoming https://github.com/orgs/hawtio/projects/1[Hawtio 4.0,role=externalLink,window=_blank]!

It should be straightforward to upgrade to new Jolokia 2 in JVM agent mode. WAR agent users should use any compatible JakartaEE 9+ container. Check out our xref:migration.adoc[Migration to 2.x] guide for more information.

Your support and patience over these years have been incredible. We're grateful for your enduring loyalty. Let's end this year on a high note and step into 2024 with new energy and possibilities!

Warm regards, +
Grzegorz, Tadayoshi, Roland
