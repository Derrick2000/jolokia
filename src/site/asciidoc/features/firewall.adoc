== Firewall friendly

image:../images/features/firewall_large.png["Firewall",role=right]
Since Jolokia uses HTTP (or HTTPS) for its transport protocol,
it plays nicely with even complex firewall setups. For the
client within a firewall it is easy to access Jolokia agents
outside over an HTTP proxy, even over multiple hops. Also
since HTTP is such a widely adopted protocol, it is much
better accepted than RMI, which mostly specific to the Java
world (or CORBA world if using IIOP). Hence chances are much
higher to get an agreement with the firewall policies in
place.

Since HTTP use a single, fixed port it is easy to let Jolokia
communicate through an SSH tunnel, too. This is not easy with
the standard JSR-160 protocol RMI, which uses random
ports. There are solutions to fix the port, but they are
horrible complicated.

With Jolokia's link:proxy.html[proxy mode] there are
even more options to let the Java servers without any agent
within the firewall to be reached from the outside over HTTP.

There has been efforts to put JSR-160 on a different protocol
stack, but they are either not a standard solution, requiring
a special client setup (like https://mx4j.sourceforge.net/[MX4J]) or seemed to
have been dropped (WS connector which uses SOAP
had its last pre-release in October 2008). Up to now, the only
solution which allows for a smooth, firewall friendly setup is
a JMX Bridge (or Proxy), like Jolokia.

* See why jolokia is the link:polyglot.html[perfect choice] for non-Java environments
to access Java servers via JMX.
* Jolokia is link:simple.html[simple]. Really.
