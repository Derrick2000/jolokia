_Before praising Jolokia to be the fasted remote JMX
solution on the world,
it has to be confessed, that we don't have any hard benchmarks
yet. But this is something on the todo list._

Jolokia is especially a very fast JMX remote accessing
solution for non-Java environments since for a client there is
no need to start a JVM which needs some time to
startup. E.g. most of the Nagios JMX plugins out there,
require a local JVM installation and the plugins, which are
implemented in Java, queries the MBeans via JSR-160 and prints
out the results to standard output for a single check, opening
a new connection for each request. For large Nagios
installations which monitors hundreds of servers for several
parameters this poses a performance problem. With Jolokia, it
has been confirmed that it scales up very well in a Nagios
environment with 500 servers monitoring about 10 parameters on
each server every 5 minutes.

Especially link:bulk-requests.html[bulk requests] can
speed up monitoring considerably. This unique feature, which
is not available for JSR-160 connectors, allows for quering
many parameters with a single server turnaround.

Jolokia uses the https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/wiki/PerformanceTesting[super fast,role=externalLink] JSON serialization
library https://code.google.com/p/json-simple/[json-simple,role=externalLink]. Along with the fact that
JSON itself is a very compact data format with small overhead
compared to RMI, this adds to the good performance experience.

In summary, all these facts indicate that the Jolokia is
faster than standard JSR-160 connectors with communication of
RMI. A benchmark is pending to put these statements on a solid
ground.
