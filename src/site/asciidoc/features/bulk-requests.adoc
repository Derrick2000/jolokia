== Bulk Requests

image:../images/features/bulk_requests_large.png["Bulk-Requests",role=right]
In order to monitor Java application servers, a multitude of
parameters can be observed. Memory and thread consumption,
database connection pool utilisation, HTTP request response
for various web application are examples for valuable metrics
to monitor. Typically, 10-20 monitored attributes are a good
setup for a single Java EE server.

With the traditional approach using JSR-160 JMX connectors,
a connection is opened, and for each attribute queried a
separate RMI (or optional JMXMP) request needs to be send to
the server resulting in several client-server turnarounds.
Wouldn't it be nice to use a single request for querying all
those parameters?

With Jolokia's *bulk requests* this is a piece
of cake. A single HTTP POST request can carry a list of JSON
request objects, which are dispatched by the Jolokia agent on
the server side into multiple local JMX calls. The results are
collected and returned as list of JSON response objects. In
case of an exception when executing the JMX call, the error is
propragated as part of the response without influencing the
other results.

=== Example

Let's have a look at an example. Jolokias client libraries
(currently available for link:../client/javascript.html[JavaScript],
link:../client/java.html[Java] and
link:../client/perl.html[Perl]) make the usage of bulk
request easy by providing an extra layer of abstraction:

[source,java,options=nowrap]
----
J4pClient j4pClient = new J4pClient("http://localhost:8080/jolokia/");
J4pRequest req1 = new J4pExecRequest("java.lang:type=Memory","gc");
J4pRequest req2 = new J4pReadRequest("java.lang:type=Memory","HeapMemoryUsage");
List<J4pResponse<J4pRequest>> responses = j4pClient.execute(req1,req2);
Map memVals = responses.get(1).getValue();
System.out.println("Memory used: " + memVals.get("used"));
----

This gets translated in the following JSON request, which is
transmitted to the agent via an HTTP POST request (the URL has
been set up in the `j4pClient` object above):

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "operation":"gc",
        "mbean":"java.lang:type=Memory",
        "type":"EXEC"
    },
    {
        "mbean":"java.lang:type=Memory",
        "attribute":"HeapMemoryUsage",
        "type":"READ"
    }
]
----

The answer returned is also represented in JSON and looks like
this:

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "timestamp":1285442161,
        "status":200,
        "request": {
            "mbean":"java.lang:type=Memory",
            "operation":"gc",
            "type":"exec"
        },
        "value":null
    },
    {
        "timestamp":1285442161,
        "status":200,
        "request": {
            "mbean":"java.lang:type=Memory",
            "attribute":"HeapMemoryUsage",
            "type":"read"
        },
        "value": {
            "max":"129957888",
            "committed":"85000192",
            "init":"0",
            "used":"3660720"
        }
    }
]
----

Another example how bulk requests can be used is the
https://www.nagios.org/[Nagios,role=externalLink]
Plugin
https://search.cpan.org/~roland/jmx4perl/scripts/check_jmx4perl[check_jmx4perl,role=externalLink],
which uses bulk requests
for its _multi check_ features, which allows for a
single Nagios check monitor as many JMX attributes and
operations as required.
