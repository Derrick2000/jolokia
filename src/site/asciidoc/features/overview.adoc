== Overview

image:../images/features/overview_large.png["Overview",role=right]
Jolokia is an agent based approach for remote JMX access. It
is an alternative to standard
https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=160[JSR 160,role=externalLink]
connectors. The communication between client and agent goes
over HTTP (either GET or POST), where the request and response
payload is represented in JSON.

The Jolokia protocol supports the following operations:

* Reading and writing JMX attributes
* Execution of JMX operations
* Searching for MBean Names by pattern
* Listing of MBean Meta-data like supported attributes,
operations and notifications
* #new in Jolokia 2# Registering to and receiving JMX notifications

Jolokia's overall architecture is shown in the next
diagram. The agent translates between JSON over HTTP and calls
to local MBeans, including a JSON serialization of the return
values.

This approach has some advantages:

* With help of the agent Jolokia is able to provide services
which go beyond the functionality of JSR-160 connectors:
** xref:bulk-requests.adoc[Bulk requests] which
allow for multiple JMX calls within a single request
** Fine grained xref:security.adoc[security] with
access restriction on MBean operation and attribute
level.
** Merging of multiple `MBeanServer` into one
virtual view, so there's no need to know in advance
which MBean is registered in which
`MBeanServer`. With JSR-160 the target
`MBeanServer` has to be known in advance.
** History mode for storing previous fetched values in a
cache on the server side, along with a time stamp. This
is especially useful to calculate the change of JMX
attributes without need of a client storage.
** No Java is required on the
xref:polyglot.adoc[client] side due to the platform
neutral nature of HTTP and JSON.
** JSON serialization allows for deep access into returned
objects without having custom type definitions installed
on the client side.
* Since HTTP uses a single predefined port, this setup plays nicely with
xref:firewall.adoc[firewall] configuration. The
JSR-160 default connector in contrast is not that smart
since RMI uses a random port for its communication by
default.
* As paradox as it might sound, setting up an agent is often
xref:simple.adoc[easier] than setting up the
configuration for JSR-160 JMX export, especially when it
comes to security. Typically, for JSR-160 export startup
files and configuration of the application server has to be
adapted. The standard agent gets deployed as a regular
web-application, which is a well known procedure.

The single disadvantage of this mode is, that an agent has to
be installed. This might be for policy reasons that no
external application is allowed to be installed. Or all
servers to be monitored are already prepared for JSR-160 JMX
export so an extra installation step is not welcome. Also,
updating Jolokia normally implies a redeployment of the
agent. These are all good reasons, for which Jolokia has an
answer, too. By installing a dedicated Java EE-Server with an
deployed agent, Jolokia can operate in
xref:proxy.adoc[proxy mode], in which case it translate
Jolokia JSON request into JSR-160 client request for operation
on the target server. Vice versa, the result over a JSR-160
connector then gets translated into a JSON response which is
returned to Jolokia client.

=== Example

In order to get a feeling how the Jolokia protocol looks like,
here is an example of a simple Jolokia request and
response. Assuming that an
xref:../agent.adoc[agent] is installed, the following
HTTP `GET`
request reads the used heap memory statistics of the instrumented JVM:

----
http://localhost:8080/jolokia/read/java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage
----

`http://localhost:8080/jolokia` is the base URL
under which the agent is reachable.
The same request can be done by POSTing the following body
to the URL `http://localhost:8080/jolokia`:

[source,json]
----
{
  "type":"read",
  "mbean":"java.lang:type=Memory",
  "attribute":"HeapMemoryUsage"
}
----

In both cases, the full response contains a JSON object:

[source,json]
----
{
  "request": {
    "mbean": "java.lang:type=Memory",
    "attribute": "HeapMemoryUsage",
    "type": "read"
  },
  "value": {
    "init": 524288000,
    "committed": 532676608,
    "max": 8334082048,
    "used": 49609240
  },
  "status": 200,
  "timestamp": 1701934145
}
