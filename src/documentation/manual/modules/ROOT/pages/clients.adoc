Three client implementations exists for Jolokia: Jmx4Perl, the
Perl binding (the grandmother of all clients ;-), a Java library
and a JavaScript library. This reference describes the client
bindings bundled with Jolokia. Information about Jmx4Perl can be found
https://metacpan.org/dist/jmx4perl[elsewhere,role=externalLink,window=_blank,window=_blank].
