[#search]
=== Searching MBeans (search)

With the Jolokia search operation the agent can be queried for
MBeans with a given pattern.  Searching will be performed on every
`MBeanServer` found by the agent.

[#get-search]
==== GET search request

The format of the search GET URL is:

----
<base-url>/search/<pattern>
----

This mode is used to query for certain MBean. It takes a single
argument `pattern` for
specifying the search parameter like in

----
http://localhost:8080/jolokia/search/*:j2eeType=J2EEServer,*
----

You can use patterns as described
https://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/management/ObjectName.html[here],
i.e. it may contain wildcards like `*` and
`?`. The Mbean names matching the query
are returned as a list within the response.

[#post-search]
==== POST search request

A search POST request knows the following keys:

.POST Search Request
|===
|Key|Description|Example

|`type`
|*`search`*
|

|`mbean`
|The MBean pattern to search for
|`java.lang:*`
|===

The following request searches for all MBeans registered in the
domain `java.lang`

[,json]
----
{
  "type": "SEARCH",
  "mbean": "java.lang:*"
}
----

[#response-search]
==== Search response

The answer is a list of MBean names which matches the pattern or an empty
list if there was no match.

For example, the request

----
http://localhost:8888/jolokia/search/*:j2eeType=J2EEServer,*
----

[,json]
----
{
  "value": [
    "jboss.management.local:j2eeType=J2EEServer,name=Local"
  ],
  "status": 200,
  "timestamp": 1245305648,
  "request": {
    "mbean": "*:j2eeType=J2EEServer,*",
    "type": "search"
  }
}
----

The returned MBean names are properly
https://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/management/ObjectName.html[quoted]
so that they can be directly used as
input for other requests.
